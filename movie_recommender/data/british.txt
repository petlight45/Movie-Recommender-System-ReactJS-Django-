Johnny is forever trying to fight his feelings for Ava- knowing he ruined that relationship long ago. Johnny is the father figure to the children. Jay owns a surf shop- and is trying to win back ex-girlfriend and teenage love- Erica Spaulding. He acts as the cool big brother type to the 3 children and he and Bradin develop a close relationship. Bradin is growing up and finding himself led astray very easily in the teenage world. He drinks- takes drugs and gets arrested- after getting involved with a 'bad-apple' Sara- who he then helps into getting her life back on track. Later he falls in love with Callie- only to get hurt again. He discovers a passion for surfing and becomes very good- whilst falling for his coach- Erica Spaulding. Nikki is at an awkward age of 13 and trying to fit in to the Californian teenage world. She is very bright and enjoys reading books and writing poetry- not the popular shopping and clothes. Early on Nikki meets a boy- Cameron Bale- and they develop a strong relationship- and ultimately- fall in love. Derrick takes to Johnny immediately and the two develop a good friendship. He-in turn- finds his "one soul mate" in a little girl called Martha.

She's a young- strikingly beautiful- provincial Northern woman who has moved to a London suburb to take her first teaching job. Jenny has rented a room in the home of a middle-aged couple- Dick and Martha Thompson. Dick Thompson- is apparently some sort of an auctioneer and his wife Martha Thompson is bored- cynical- and openly suspicious of attractive young Jenny. The Thompsons' other lodger- Anna- is apparently French. Jenny soon meets Patrick Standish- an acquaintance of the Thompsons- who is immediately attracted to her. Patrick takes Jenny on a date to what seems to her to be a fashionable- upmarket Italian restaurant- but which Amis makes clear is a classless suburban pseudo-Italianate place. Impressed- Jenny lets Patrick take her back to the house he shares with Graham- an unattractive Scottish schoolmaster. Heavy petting ensues and Patrick assumes that Jenny will sleep with him- but instead she rebuffs him and explains that she intends to remain a virgin until she is married. The rest of the novel concerns itself with Patrick's attempts to seduce Jenny (and his first efforts at sexual fidelity)- and with Jenny's attempts to fend off his attentions and those of many others who are attracted to her. Eventually- Patrick gives Jenny an ultimatum: either she goes to bed with him or the relationship is over. Jenny finds herself unable to comply and they part.

The latest group he targets is the wives and partners of those in the military. This specific ten month project will include those stationed at R.M.B. Chivenor and the Royal Citadel in Plymouth. He believes military wives are unsung heroines who remain stoic in their quiet support of their husbands and the military as a whole. However- he feels that they do not have a formal place in the military- and thus literally and figuratively do not have a voice. He is hoping that the setting up of a choir of military wives will not only provide a distraction for the wives as their husbands are sent overseas - in these specific cases- a six month tour of duty in Afghanistan - but also that missing voice. He also wants the choirs to act as a formal mechanism to pay respect to the military which is the world in which they live- but also a place within that military to provide the support back to the wives. This task may become all the more difficult if there are casualties overseas- not only of the husbands of choir members- but of any member of the British military who trained at those two specific bases.,nan,nan,Documentary

This eclectic bunch of anthropomorphic cattle travel around in a large RV that they've 'borrowed' from some extreme sports fanatics. The vehicle comes complete with every piece of extreme sports equipment imaginable and amazingly- it turns out that each of the gang has a great aptitude for various kinds of sports. During their travels the gang inadvertently foil various villainous plots or scupper the plans of cheats as they take part in sporting contests.

Xavier meets all kinds of different folk on his journey who he bores to tears with self obsessed tales about his life and his ability to "blow minds-" and encounters rednecks who don't take kindly to his appearance. He speaks in a low- gruff- movie trailer-type tone that accentuates his narcissistic rambling. Although Xavier has a sense of morality and means well- he tends to cause havoc wherever he goes- attempting to help characters along the way- but unknowingly making situations worse due to total incompetence. In the pilot episode- we see in a flash-back that he burnt his house down as an adolescent whilst practicing a spiritual ritual. The fire killed his adoptive parents- yet he is totally oblivious that it was his fault- and is still out to find whoever is responsible. When asked if he has any powers- he is heard to say "powers are for the weak-" yet the truth is that he has few- if any- as he is incapable of executing them efficiently.,nan,TV-MA,Animation- Adventure- Comedy

Very empowering for women and children alike. It's 'revolting' rhymes though so these are twists on the fairy tales. Part one is the wolf telling the stories of red and Snow White.

He continued his hosting duties when the series moved to television. Two four-member teams- each representing a college or university- competed; one was a returning champion. Ludden read a toss-up question (usually difficult) rooted in the liberal arts; subjects ranged from mathematics and science- engineering- literature- law and history to physics- music- philosophy- journalism and much more. Correct answers allowed the team to answer multiple-part bonus questions (which could involve the use of maps- graphs and sound-bites of music and famous speeches); control passed to the other team for any incorrect question. Each game lasted 24 minutes- divided in halves; between halves- a short film promoting the challenging team's university was played. The winning team at the end of the game won $1-500 for their school's scholarship fund- while losing teams won $500 (the stakes would increase by the end of the show's run). Winning teams could stay for up to five weeks- at which point they won a special trophy. Local stations often aired "High School Bowl-" a high-school adaptation of "College Bowl" with four-member teams from local high schools competing in an otherwise identical format.

Well-mannered cousin Lucy Deane (Moira Durbridge) is a mutual friend and peacemaker between the two. Over the years- Phillip Wakem (Anton Lesser)- another neighbor- will also enter their orbit.

Either way- Tom doesn't approve - nor- as it turns out- does Mr. Wakem. Further- as the fortunes of the latter rise- the Tullivers fall so far they lose their mill. But all is not lost. Tom will keep the family afloat when he finds employment with Lucy's father- Uncle Deane (John Stratton)- around the same time Lucy's suitor- Stephen Guest (John Moulder-Brown)- switches his focus to Maggie.

The bossy- implicitly man-hungry widow Mrs. Betty Slocombe supervises the attractive Miss Shirley Brahms (with a terribly common Cockney accent) -with first choice of customers- on commission- the sale of women's clothes and accessories; the sales star at the gentleman's side is Mr. Wilberforce Clayborne Humpries- an implied closet-gay true gentleman- whose successive superiors are first obviously nearly retired Mr. Ernest Grainger and later formerly independent Mr. Grosman while the successive cheeky juniors are Mr. Dick Lucas and Mr. Bert Spooner. A regular visitor- and the only manual laborer but apparently best paid- is union representative Mr. Mash.

They are led by the pompous Mainwaring- manager of the local bank- and consist of the suave- mild-mannered Sergeant Wilson - Lance-Corporal Jones- the town's butcher and an old soldier prone to hysteria- cockney spiv Walker- dour Scots undertaker Frazer- gentle- elderly and incontinent Godfrey and dim-witted mummy's boy- Pike- whose mother is 'friendly' with Wilson. They are based in the Church hall where there is much friction between Mainwaring- the effeminate Vicar- his creeping Verger and ARP Warden Hodges (the grocer) who calls Mainwaring 'Napoleon' and strongly dislikes him. The 80 episodes (the last 68 made in colour) have been frequently repeated- many are available on video and there was a 1971 Cinema version.

Fragments from the asteroid- and even from the moon itself- penetrate Earth's atmosphere and make impact. Even though the initial damage is minimal- nerves are frayed throughout the planet. There is significant physical damage to the lunar surface- but experts quickly conclude there will be no lasting ramifications. Then strange anomalies begin to manifest themselves on Earth. It starts small - cell phone disruptions- unusual static charges and odd tidal behavior. The world's leading scientists- including Alex Kittner- Maddie Rhodes and Roland Emerson- begin piecing together evidence that suggests the moon's properties- and its orbit- may have been permanently altered. Their fears are realized when the anomalies increase to the point where the effect of "simulated" gravity is being manipulated by increased electromagnetic surges coming from the moon. People- cars and other objects are rendered momentarily weightless in random- isolated areas around the globe. Alex- Maddie- Roland and the rest of their team soon discover something far worse - the moon's new orbit has put it on a collision course with Earth! The world now has 39 days to stop it or Earth- and all of mankind- will perish. After a failed attempt by the United States to destroy the moon- our heroes bring all the countries of the world together in one last hope for humanity - an international mission to the moon itself where astronauts will attempt to reverse the magnetic effects and restore the moon to its original orbit. Alex- whose children are now missing after the latest rampage of anti-gravity- is emotionally torn as he must now join Roland and two other astronauts on the Earth saving mission into space.

Alternating moments of gentle character comedy with broad slapstick- it recounts the misadventures of the local voluntary defence force (or 'Home Guard') consisting of men too old or 'unfit' for military service. They are led by the pompous Mainwaring- manager of the local bank- and consist of the suave- mild-mannered Sergeant Wilson - Lance-Corporal Jones- the town's butcher and an old soldier prone to hysteria- cockney spiv Walker- dour Scots undertaker Frazer- gentle- elderly and incontinent Godfrey and dim-witted mummy's boy- Pike- whose mother is 'friendly' with Wilson. They are based in the Church hall where there is much friction between Mainwaring- the effeminate Vicar- his creeping Verger and ARP Warden Hodges (the grocer) who calls Mainwaring 'Napoleon' and strongly dislikes him.

The bossy- implicitly man-hungry widow Mrs. Betty Slocombe supervises the attractive Miss Shirley Brahms (with a terribly common Cockney accent) -with first choice of customers- on commission- the sale of women's clothes and accessories; the sales star at the gentleman's side is Mr. Wilberforce Clayborne Humpries- an implied closet-gay true gentleman- whose successive superiors are first obviously nearly retired Mr. Ernest Grainger and later formerly independent Mr. Grosman while the successive cheeky juniors are Mr. Dick Lucas and Mr. Bert Spooner.

He feels that the rest of the world is against him and he wages a constant war against the tyranny of adults. Like any headstrong young boy- he is determined- relentless- he doesn't hold back and he never admits defeat! He will stop at nothing to outwit the enemy and teachers- relatives and babysitters avoid him at all costs. Even his parents argue over whose turn it is to look after him! Henry is endearingly straight forward and lives for the moment- he'll wolf down his little brother Peter's chocolates before even thinking of an alibi! He doesn't try to be truly horrid- it just comes naturally! He's still young- however- and can be scared by talk of ghosts or monsters. The school doctor's syringe reduces him to a quivering heap! Although Henry is certainly proud of himself- he never learns from his mistakes. Henry indulges in fantasies- transforms into terrifying creatures to match his frustrations and often has 'Eureka moments' when he has what he thinks is a spectacularly wonderful idea. In every story- there is something Henry has to get or do (or occasionally avoid doing) and the ensuing chaos is the consequence of this overriding desire. When he thinks of a plan it is simple to get his own way- never to make trouble purely for its own sake. He takes life very seriously and he sincerely believes in what he is doing. No wonder his favorite saying is ... 'it's not fair!!!!',nan,TV-Y7,Animation- Comedy- Family- Fantasy- Music

As the primary audience of the series is heterosexual men- there are both heterosexual and lesbian sex scenes throughout the series. The sex is simulated; however- scenes with male erections- oral sex and masturbation are explicit in that some contact is visible.

The bodies of Lesley and John Kilbride are discovered in shallow graves on Saddleworth moor and Brady and Hindley are tried for murder- receiving multiple life sentences- though David is exonerated despite the pair trying to implicate him and it will be some years before the murderers confess to the whereabouts of other victims. Five years later the Smiths have separated and Maureen is persuaded by her grandma to visit Myra- who has now embraced religion and says that she will always be haunted by her crimes. David is annoyed that his wife made the visit but Maureen tells him she believes her sister has genuinely changed and the pair reconcile for their children's sake.

Carlota has grown up in a world dominated by her mother- Bernada- who emotionally abuses her and her older sister- Eugenia. Cordelia has grown up in a little town surrounded by farms and ranches. Cordelia is obsessed with wealth and power and will stop at nothing to get it. The story begins as Eugenia gets pregnant out of wedlock- faced by embarrassment Bernada sends her to a small town- the town in which Cordelia resides. Meanwhile Eugenia is gone and never spoken of- Carlota starts dating a doctor named Alvaro- it is true love. However- Bernada won't allow it- because if any of her daughters get married- Bernada will have to give them each their inheritance which is everything Bernada has. As their love grows- Alvaro's parents move into a ranch in the small town in which Cordelia lives- at their arrival she immediately starts plotting ways to get wealth and power. Unfortunately- two deaths occur on the same day- Alvaro's mom dies of a heart attack and Eugenia dies at child birth(her child is hidden away from Bernada due to Eugenia finding out her mother's true greedy nature). Alvaro succumbed by grief goes to the ranch- Carlota also discovers the news of her sister's death and is devastated. When Alvaro returns to look for Carlota he finds a coffin at her home- Bernada tricks him by saying it is Carlota who has died. He cannot take it and goes to his parents' house. There he meets Cordelia- who takes advantage of his grief over his mother's death- but to her surprise he is immediately taken by her resemblance to Carlota- which Cordelia later uses as her ticket into wealth and power as his wife. Years pass- Carlota has been torn and depressed by Alvaro's "abandonment" and her sister's death. She lives in a new town with new people and cannot let go of the past. Alvaro has been married to Cordelia and has a daughter named Natalia- however their marriage is a sham- a mistake from the beginning. Alvaro cannot let go of Carlota- and Cordelia has never cared about him and is having an affair with his brother- Adrian- who is as dangerous as she is. As fate would have it- while Carlota is in Mexico city on a trip- Cordelia goes there to stay with Adrian- they meet each other at the mall. They exchange a few words- Cordelia decides to conceal the fact that she is married to Alvaro. Adrian also happens to see them- discovering that Carlota is alive he tries to blackmail Cordelia. Meanwhile- as Bernada strolls through Mexico City she meets a handsome young man who is interested in her- Roman Guillen- the son of the man she had an affair with and ensnared him by revealing to everyone they had two daughters- Eugenia and Carlota. Roman does not know it is Bernada he is interested in until he looks for her in her home town- once he finds out who she is he plots his revenge on her. Alvaro and Cordelia continue to fight and it takes it toll on Natalia- who just wants to have a happy family. Cordelia promises to change and complies for a while until a family trip(at the request of Natalia) is planned- Cordelia ditches them and asks Carlota to take her place. Knowing how delicate the situation might be- Cordelia tricks Carlota into thinking that Alvaro is a bad husband who abuses any woman in his life- them being two examples. She uses Natalia as the sole reason why Carlota must take her place- to do it for the girl. Carlota agrees and manages to fall in love with Alvaro all over again- Alvaro also feels the same thing- not knowing it is Carlota who he is having these feelings for. Shortly after the vacation cruise is over- Carlota decides to leave her mom's house and moves to Mexico City on her own. Cordelia and Adrian relationship gets rockier- until Cordelia decides to have him killed- she plants a poisonous snake in his tub and awaits for it to kill Adrian as he bathes. But- somehow they begin to fight and she is pulled in and is killed instead. Adrian fakes a letter by Cordelia saying she left the ranch and will never come back. Natalia takes this badly and gets ill. Afraid that question will arise- Adrian asks Carlota- on Cordelia's part through another fake letter- if she could take her place once more because Natalia is sick. Carlota agrees despite her growing love and hate towards Alvaro- the man that made a fool of her all those years back. She leaves for Alvaro's ranch- missing her bus which later crashes and she is among the list of dead victims. Bernada finds out her daughter is "dead"- and she cannot collect the inheritance unless a body is found. Carlota takes her place as Cordelia- the strict lady of the ranch- but her loving- compassionate personality often surfaces- making others suspect she is another woman. Carlota faces many challenges and lies- she discovers her nephew is alive and lives in the town- truth about her mother- and convincing everyone she is Cordelia. Will her hate over Alvaro triumph and keep on focused on her goal to get Natalia better then divorce him as Cordelia- or will she slowly let her guard down and reveal she is not Cordelia but the other? Or will her mother find her and reveal to everyone who she is?,nan,nan,Drama- Mystery- Romance
