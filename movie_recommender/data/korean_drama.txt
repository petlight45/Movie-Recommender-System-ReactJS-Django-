The link for Korea is Incheon International Airport. Passengers- freight and airplanes take off and land at this place. With 30-000 airport employees working to keep the airport open 24 hours a day. 21 government agencies are located on the airport premises. Airport is more than just an airport: It is a small city. Just like how one airplane part is essential to the safety of the whole flight- every single person who works at Incheon Airport plays an important role in handling the airplane take-offs and landings. "Aircity" is a story about these dedicated people. When your plane ticket is processed and board a plane after having a seat assigned to you- then the pilot will navigate the plane to your destination. After your plane lands- you need to go to the exit gates. It looks like a simple but in fact takes lots of procedure behind and Aircity will show you what happens behind the scenes as people work hard to make your flight arrive on time without a problem. The characters of this drama harbor a common goal to establish another aircity in the African continent. The goal accompanies many challenges and the characters overcome those challenges one by one. They are courageous and aggressive when it comes to work but the stories of their love is sometimes difficult- foolish and a bit clumsy. But as much as they are faithful to their passions and dreams- they are always respectful of others. Han Do Kyung- specially scouted by the Incheon Airport Director- come back to Korea as the chief of operations of Incheon Airport with much lower salaries. However- Do Kyung lives with an uneven wound of her family and a regret of leaving her sister behind. She met Kim Ji Sung- a National Intelligence Service agent and gets entangle with him. Kim Ji Sung is very passionate about his work to the extend that he is willing to bend the rules to ensure the security of the country even if he is only acting on his instincts. After being stationed at the airport- he finds himself in an emotional turmoil with a woman he used to love. At the same time- he is falling for Han Do Kyung. Kang Ha Joon- a childhood friend of Han Do Kyung is also falling for Do Kyung. Kang Ha Joon is a quick tempered with a habit of talking aggressively due to his nature of work watching over thousands of surveillance cameras in the airport but has good relations with all the airport employees even the cleaners because of his kind personality outside of work. As his friendship develops with Do Kyung- he becomes a strong source of refuge for her. But as his feelings for her grows- his relationship gets more and more complicated with a woman who is his friend- superior at workplace and unrequited love.,TV-Y,Action- Drama- Romance,1

Eun-Ho and Dong-Jin meet one day at the bookstore where he works at and they're immediately drawn to each other. They fall in love after subsequent meetings- and the two are married like millions of others who are in similar situations. But two years later they are divorced- and that's where the story opens. A pair of divorcées sitting across from each other talking about each other's lives. There's nothing about them that stands out from the crowd. They have ordinary jobs- he works at a bookstore and she at the fitness club. Neither is extremely good-looking- nor rich- nor charismatic. But there is something different about them- and as the story reveals the reasons behind their divorce- their continuing meetings after divorce- their mingling in each other's lives- their matchmaking attempt for each other- and their internal monologues about each other- it becomes apparent they are each other's destiny if such thing exists. But even so- getting back together might be asking too much- since that would open up a wound that they've tried to bury for three years. Furthermore their new love-interests- Mi-Youn and Hyeon-Joong are marking their steps into Dong-Jin and Eun-Ho's lives- and the new love might just be a wiser option for two that have tried but failed already. In fact- Hyeon-Joong may have more things in common with Eun-Ho than she ever did with Dong-Jin- and Mi-Youn seems to need Dong-Jin more than Eun-Ho ever did- this alone might be enough for the pair of divorcées to finally cut the tie between them.,nan,Drama- Romance,1

Ambitious- he moved into TV dramas which he helps with his star power and hinders with his terrible acting. He also has an exploitative- unethical manager. Yoon Gae Hwa is a housewife divorced from a rich husband who needs to earn enough money to keep her daughter in her custody while her ex-husband's new wife doesn't want the daughter of a previous wife around. Gae Hwa's sole prior work experience is 6 months as a reporter for a weekly scandal rag. Her first jobs shown in the series are unsuccessful but include 1 day as housekeeper for Sung Min Woo where a babysitting emergency forces her to leave early- infuriating Sung Min Woo. Shortly afterwards- she finds another job at a musical production company- learns a secret about Sung Min Woo- and convinces him to work on the agency's musical- and becomes Min Woo's handler for that agency as it prepares to put on a musical starring Min Woo (if he ever improves as an actor). Handling Min Woo is no easy task due to their mutual antagonism- spurred by Min Woo's immaturity. Min Woo grows up as he faces the challenges of caring for his unexpected 5-year-old daughter Ye Eun- the result of an affair several years earlier- and by Gae Hwa's example in caring for the otherwise unprotected Ye Eun. Min Woo gains maturity very quickly as he learns to accept and love his daughter and becomes something unexpected - a good actor.

Now fearing she might be too old to find love again- Alana forces herself back into the dating world only to discover just how much it and she have both changed. Well... everything except her new found desire to never let another man tie her down into a serious relationship - at least not without a ring and court house papers. But can a series of dates with a lot of Mr. Wrongs finally lead her into the arms of Mr. Right? The series also features Alana's two best friends- the anti-aging obsessed- beautiful Coco and the tightly wound divorcée Krystal- who have opposing views on men- DWO and life in general. Join Alana and friends as they deal with the challenges- triumphs and therapy-worthy moments of being "Single... Again".,nan,Comedy- Drama- Romance,nan
