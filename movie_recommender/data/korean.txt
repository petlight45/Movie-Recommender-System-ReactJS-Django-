Each contestant called out a pair of numbers on the board which contained the names of prizes- humorous joke prizes and WILD and action cards (the latter three explained later). No match passed control to the opponent- but a match gave whatever prize was printed on the card or allowed him to perform an action- revealed two pieces of the rebus (identifying a person- phrase- place- thing- etc.) and allowed him/her a chance to solve the rebus. WILD cards provided an automatic match- while TAKE cards allowed the contestant at that moment to snatch a prize his/her opponent might have in their possession. A FORFEIT card meant the player immediately had to give up one of the prizes he/she had in his possession. The joke prizes (things such as a banana peel- a button- etc.) actually served as insurance markers against opponents TAKE cards and the FORFEIT cards he/she might stumble upon. Only upon correctly solving the rebus does a player actually win what he/she claimed from the board; the loser forfeits all his gifts. Originally- there was no bonus game; later in the run came "The Envelope and its Mysterious Contents" (which hid cash amounts or a prize such as a car)- and still later- "The Cash Wheel" which allowed a player to win up to $2-000 cash. Champions continued until either defeated or by winning 20 games; the top winners each season returned to play a "Tournament of Champions." During the original run of "Concentration-" the show reportedly gave away 512 cars- 397 boats- 1-287 domestic and foreign trips and cruises- 12 trips around the world- 857 fur coats and numerous diamonds not to mention all the travel trailers- airplanes- swimming pools- furniture and countless other items (one history on the show reported the total prize giveaway at $10 million).,nan,TV-G,Game-Show

Its moral and economic owner is Dalmiro Bernal. He and Mercedes- his wife- run a Spa and hotel which- at the beginning of the story is about to celebrate its twentieth anniversary. 25 years ago- Mercedes got pregnant by Flauta- the town artist- bohemian and intellectual. Mercedes- being only 18- decided not to tell him about the baby- and went away to terminate the pregnancy and in everybody's eyes- she was going to the city to study. After careful thinking- she decided to have the baby and then give it up. Her parents- seeing she was very committed to her pregnancy- and foreseeing she wouldn't want to give it up- decided to deceive her telling her that the baby had been stillborn. The truth is that her baby girl- was born healthy and will be the protagonist of this story. Carmen- the name was given to her by her foster parents- is a girl with changing interests; considering her genetic heritage- she is closer to Flauta- her father- than to Mercedes- who studied medicine. Love of something or somebody is the main theme in our story- the characters move driven by old and new passions- and that's how Carmen arrives in town- believing a small amount of money will help her out of Argentina. Whereas Javier- one of the men who will change his life forever- arrives at Desire with the pressing need of getting a job done and leaving as soon as possible. But thanks to Dalmiro- he will become the leading man in the town's radio- something he longed for during his whole life- and that will give him the strongest support to take up again his old profession in front of a mike. The apparent tranquility of Desire is altered by these strangers who- related to Flauta- will form a block against Dalmiro and his power- and this will confront mother and daughter even further. The characters from Desire would rather not walk along the swamp zone. The try to avoid looking back- but the muddy waters will try to gain the space of the healing and transparent waters of the Bernals' Spa. And that means that the past- and all its deaths will prevail over the present filled with mystery and lies.,nan,nan,Romance- Drama- Mystery
