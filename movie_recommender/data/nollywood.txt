That card is the reason why he begins to engage in Cardfights- something that changes his life drastically. The name of the card game is Vanguard. The game takes place in a different planet called Cray. It is a place similar to our own planet- but unlike planet Earth- Gods and Demons- Dragons and other mythical creatures still roam the land. It is also a world where both Magic and Science have advanced hand in hand. Countries with advances in different fields and cultures rule over different parts of the planet Cray. And due to a never before seen play system- it becomes popular throughout the world. Aichi- immediately attracted by Vanguard- meets friends such as Misaki Togura and Kamui Katsuragi- along with other rivals. Through friendly rivalry with them- Aichi begins to enjoy a fulfilling life. Aichi- however- has a goal: to once again battle with a Vanguard Fighter by the name of Toshiki Kai. Toshiki Kai is an aloof and cold-hearted high schooler who has outstanding abilities in the world of Vanguard. He is also the reason why Aichi started playing the game. For him- Kai is the person who saved him from his boring life and introduced him to Vanguard. In order to get better at Vanguard- Aichi puts his soul into it every day.
