The protagonist of this story- Aichi Sendo- is a timid boy in his third year of middle school. He had been living his life looking backward rather than forward- trying not to stand out. However- he had one thing that kept him going - the Blaster Blade- a card from a card game that was given to him when he was little. That card is the reason why he begins to engage in Cardfights- something that changes his life drastically. The name of the card game is Vanguard. The game takes place in a different planet called Cray. It is a place similar to our own planet- but unlike planet Earth- Gods and Demons- Dragons and other mythical creatures still roam the land. It is also a world where both Magic and Science have advanced hand in hand. Countries with advances in different fields and cultures rule over different parts of the planet Cray. And due to a never before seen play system- it becomes popular throughout the world. Aichi- immediately attracted by Vanguard- meets friends such as Misaki Togura and Kamui Katsuragi- along with other rivals. Through friendly rivalry with them- Aichi begins to enjoy a fulfilling life. Aichi- however- has a goal: to once again battle with a Vanguard Fighter by the name of Toshiki Kai. Toshiki Kai is an aloof and cold-hearted high schooler who has outstanding abilities in the world of Vanguard. He is also the reason why Aichi started playing the game. For him- Kai is the person who saved him from his boring life and introduced him to Vanguard. In order to get better at Vanguard- Aichi puts his soul into it every day. He wishes that someday- he'll be able to battle Kai and have him recognize his worth.,nan,nan,Animation- Action- Fantasy- Game-Show- Sci-Fi

Growing up in the sixties was like waking every day to find the world had changed. Music- fashion- politics and social and moral issues were all in a state of flux. For teenagers- it was a time of new freedom- new ideas and exciting new possibilities. For their parents- society's changing attitudes were confronting- painful and- at times- downright impossible. Introduction of the contraceptive pill-conscription- the Beatles and Bob Dylan- the Menzies era- the Cuban Missile Crisis-assassination of US President John Fitzgerald Kennedy-and his brother Robert- anti-hanging protests- the Profumo affair- the assassination of civil rights champion Martin Luther-King- the Vietnam War. All The Way is set against the background of these events- with the ingenious use of archival footage to weave together the intrigue of a political thriller with the lives of three Australian families- who- although from different social backgrounds- find they all must face the challenges of a rapidly changing world. The story begins on November 22- 1963 - the day an assassin's bullet cut down US President John F Kennedy in the streets of Dallas- Texas. It was a gunshot that echoed around the world,nan,nan,Drama
