Often narrated by Laura- the series follows her simple farm upbringing from her childhood until her adulthood with Almanzo Wilder with whom she starts a family of her own. While the series is based upon the Little House books (and thus the real life of author Laura Ingalls Wilder)- it is a very loose adaptation- with mostly only key events and elements of fact surviving the transition from book to TV series- the most important being Mary's eventual blindness- and Laura's future. Several other fictitious (some factual) characters make up the friendly community of Walnut Grove- including teacher Miss Beadle (succeeded by two other teachers- then Laura- then Etta Plum)- Dr. Hiram Baker- Rev. Robert Alden- Mr. Hanson (of the Hanson lumber mill)- and the well-to-do Olesons- owners of the local mercantile- and also the primary rivals of the Ingalls family (except the Oleson patriarch).

He is married to Sarah- a Caucasian ex-Christian who has converted to Islam for her husband. Their adult daughter- Rayyan- is a feminist Muslim doctor. The religious leader of the Muslim community - the Imam - is Amaar Rashid- a young- Canadian-born ex-lawyer from Toronto- who came to Mercy to replace Baber Siddiqui- who was deemed too extreme by many in the Mercy Muslim community. The local diner is run by Fatima Dinssa- a Nigerian Muslim who is strict about her religion but more liberal in her cultural values. The Muslims in Mercy are co-existing with their Christian neighbors- sometimes harmoniously- sometimes not. Reverend Duncan Magee welcomes his Muslim neighbors- especially if they enhance the social and economic fabric of the community and his parish. Likewise- Mayor Ann Popowicz welcomes the Muslim population especially if they vote for her. However- local radio host- Fred Tupper- is suspect of the Muslims and their supposed terrorist ways. But he and many of the townsfolk- Muslim or Christian- are equally as suspect of someone like Amaar since he is from the big bad city of Toronto- a city which has shaped his views and which is contrary to the outlook of a town like Mercy.,nan,Comedy,6

Over six months and for 10 hours per day- the series captured the family's everyday successes and struggles. The result is an intimate view of life as a Little Person. Parents Matt and Amy Roloff are both little people - 4 feet tall - but they are determined to succeed in a world that isn't always accepting of differences. Matt has risen through the ranks of the business world- closing deals with some of Silicon Valley's most well-known companies. After being laid off- Matt decided to pursue his dream of owning his own business. Originally a stay-at-home mom but now holding down two jobs- Amy has raised four children: 15-year-old twins- Jeremy and Zach (Jeremy is average height and Zach is a little person)- 12-year-old Molly and 8-year-old Jacob. Together they own and operate Roloff Farms- a sprawling 34-acre farm in Oregon. The Roloffs' accomplishments belie a hard truth: for little people- every day is a challenge. Driving a car- seeing over the counter at a bank or even making a simple trip to the grocery store can quickly become a test in a world that wasn't made for them. In Little People- Big World- viewers look into the lives of the Roloffs as they face the pressure of being little in an average-sized world.,TV-G,Documentary- Reality-TV,20

The four team leaders/coaches consist of an Army Ranger sniper- a Navy Seal team leader- a Marine Corps sergeant- and an Army sergeant - all of whom have seen combat- and all of whom are highly decorated. The contestants will have to fight through challenge after challenge- all of which are modeled after real military training platforms- while dealing with the elements of the wilderness - not to mention each other.

The obstacle course stays the same throughout the competition- but the "endurance challenge" at the end of the Circus changes from week to week. A contestant cannot be voted or kicked out of this competition. The only way out of this competition is to quit. At the end of the Circus obstacle course three contestants are locked in battle in a tough endurance test. The first contestant to step out (or fall out) of the endurance test must then "ring out" of the competition. (Much in the way that Navy SEALs do during training.) The final team of four to make it to the end of the competition will split a prize of up to $1 million- giving each of the final four contestants a chance to walk away with $250-000.,nan,Game-Show- Reality-TV,2

His outward confidence also masks many insecurities as evidenced through his many vices- such as excessive smoking- drinking and womanizing - the latter despite being a family man - and how he deals with the aftermath of some of the negative aspects of his life.,TV-14,Drama,7

Host Roth shows an out of focus picture (e.g.- person- place- thing or a T.V. show)- every time the contestant buzzes in with the right identification to the picture earned 10 points and the same contestant was asked a multiple-choice question about the picture (e.g.- pop culture- storybook- spelling words- places- etc.)- worth 5 points. The first team who ended the game with 50 points was able to run inside the maze with the help of his/her partner- after a decision has been made (whether if he/she will go first or second). Then- after the first team won- the remaining two contestants went right into the speed round where each correct picture was still 10 points and host Roth will no longer have to ask anymore questions. An incorrect guess on a picture meant that Roth would read a clue to what that picture is without revealing anymore of it. The second team with 50 points went right inside the maze. In earler episodes of Season 1 is that the 3 contestants have 10 seconds to buzz in and correctly identify the picture to win whatever point value was awarded on the clock- and then the contestant can answer the question correctly in order to double their points. If time runs out or if all 3 contestants gets the picture wrong- then no points was awarded at that time- and the 1st 2 teams who ended the game with more than 50 points went into the maze.

In the Mirror Maze- the contestants' partner must navigate the contestant to the Mirror-Man (who eventually took over their path)- and the contestant must answer a question correctly posed by Roth in order to proceed. If at anytime- the contestant answers the question correctly- then they are free to go- but if they get it wrong or can't come up with an answer- then host Roth will automatically ask another question- 3 incorrect answers and/or passes the contestant has already made will force the contestant to wait for 5 more- until the runner is told to go. While finding 2 Power Sticks- the contestants' partner would have him/her go to the Honeycomb Maze- where the contestants' visor had to come down and his/her partner would have to direct him in the appropriate area of the contestant of where he/she is supposed to go- into the Chamber of Knowledge. After the contestant was told to put his/her visor up- then he/she entered the chamber to answer all 3 true/false questions from three of the six guardians. If the contestant gets 1 right from a guardian- then the door automatically opened- if the contestant gets it wrong- then one of the 5 guardians asked another question. 3 incorrect answers automatically opened the door with excessive time. If the contestant gets all 3 correct answers- then he/she took a short trip to the jar to stop the contestants' time. Then- its team #2 turn to do the same- to see if the contestant can beat the contestants' time (e.g.- 1:56 (best time ever)- 1:57- 2:40- 4:30- etc.)- and if the contestant does this even quicker- then the contestant went on to the Prize Mountain. If not- then their opponents automatically went on to Prize Mountain. In Prize Mountain- there were 5 monitors- (e.g.- both of them flashing PRIZE/NO PRIZE)- after their partner locks in on the monitor- the contestants' job is to point their lazer- aim and (shout fire very often). If the contestant fired in on 3 "PRIZE" monitors before locking in on 3 "NO PRIZE" monitors- then the contestant went home with a grand prize (e.g.- a $500 shopping spree at Sharper Image at Beverly Hills). In the fall of 1995- Roth was replaced by actor/heartthrob- Mario Lopez- and the rules stay the same- but the buzzers were replaced by laser podiums and there was a "Bonus Picture" worth 15 points- and once again- 2 teams who ended the game with 50 points went into the maze to see which teammates has the fastest time.,nan,Family- Game-Show,nan

Host Fred Rogers (known to millions as simply "Mister Rogers") used his gentle charm and mannerisms to communicate with his audience of children. Topics centered on nearly every inconceivable matter of concern to children- ranging from everyday fears related to going to sleep- getting immunizations and disappointment about not getting one's way to losing a loved one to death and physical handicaps. Rogers used simple songs and- on nearly every show- segments from the Neighborhood of Make-Believe to make his point. A scale-model trolley was often (but not always) used to segue into the Make-Believe segments- said neighborhood being inhabited by puppet characters including King Friday XIII- Lady Elaine Fairchilde and Daniel Striped Tiger. Frequent visitors as well as Rogers' own frequent visits to various places in the neighborhood rounded out each show. The program was taped at WQED-TV in Pittsburgh; first-run shows were produced from 1968 to 1975- at which time production was suspended until 1979. New programs were taped through 2001 for broadcast alongside the original 460 episodes the most notable coming in 1991 with Rogers' shows focusing on calming children's fears during the Persian Gulf War.,TV-Y,Family- Fantasy- Music,31

The once good Earth Federation is now more corrupt than ever and will turn the other way even when its special force- the Titans- commit atrocities like gassing millions of civilians to their deaths.

The schedule usually consisted of about eighteen telecasts- usually with two games airing simultaneously on a regional basis. Like Monday Night Football- they had a three-man booth. The original main booth consisted of Bob Prince- Bob Uecker- and Warner Wolf. However- Keith Jackson- Howard Cosell- and guest analyst Reggie Jackson replaced them for the 1976 ALCS. Wolf joined then Cincinnati Reds announcer Al Michaels and guest analyst Tom Seaver for the NLCS. ABC alternated with NBC coverage of the All Star Game- League Championship Series- and World Series. In even numbered years- ABC televised the All Star Game and the two League Championship Series; in odd numbered years- the World Series. Memorable post season moments on ABC included Chris Chambliss' pennant-clinching home run in 1976- Reggie Jackson's three-home run game in the 1977 World Series- the Red Sox' miracle comeback in the 1986 ALCS- and the earthquake Series of 1989. By 1983- it finally occurred to ABC that Keith Jackson was... a football announcer- and Michaels was given the primary announcer reins. In 1985- ABC had finally had enough of Cosell and settled upon the team of Al Michaels- Jim Palmer- and Tim McCarver. This would be the primary crew for the remainder of ABC's contract. By 1986- ABC only televised thirteen regular season games. Monday Night Baseball's run came to an end after 1988. For the 1989 season (the last before ABC and NBC lost baseball to CBS)- ABC switched to Thursday nights. Michaels said that losing baseball was "tough to accept." In 1994- ABC and NBC would embark in an ill-fated partnership with Major League Baseball: The Baseball Network. TBN called for games to be aired regionally on Friday and Saturday nights under the banner- "Baseball Night in America." After the 1994 players' strike nixed these plans- TBN was brought to an abrupt end. In an awkward arrangement- ABC and NBC split coverage of the 1995 World Series (ABC televised Games 1- 4- & 5- NBC 2- 3- & 6). To date- this was the last time ABC televised Major League Baseball.,nan,Sport,nan

Each week- two teams (as chosen months in advance by the NFL) met in what has become a Monday night tradition. Usually- a trio of sports-casters (a play-by-play announcer joined by a color commentator and an analyst) called the action. Half-time interviews with coaches and players- and sideline reports after outstanding plays were also innovations that contributed to the appeal of these games. Many of the games proved to be exciting- though sometimes the games were boring (especially if the teams were a mismatch or not very good- a necessary risk since the games were scheduled months in advance).

Like its earlier novel and big-screen brethren- "Mr. Belvedere" featured British butler Lynn Belvedere- who takes a job as a live-in nanny for a typical American family and records their everyday experiences in his diary for future use in writing a novel. In the 1985 small-screen version- the Owens family served as that "typical American family" and the source of fodder for Belvedere who had previously worked as a gentry for Winston Churchill and had connections to British royalty. Family patriarch George (played by sports-caster Bob Uecker) was- in an example of art imitating life- a sports writer; the matriarch was Marsha- a law student. The couple- which had settled in suburban Pittsburgh- had three children: Awkward teen-ager Kevin- precocious (and easily embarrassed) Heather and mischievous prankster Wesley. George was initially uncomfortable hiring the worldly Belvedere- but eventually came to appreciate the Englishman's friendship (as well as his expert culinary skills). Wesley- unlike his elder siblings- seemed to never get along with Belvedere; however- even he came to appreciate the British native's advice that he would regularly dispense to the family. Each episode ended with Belvedere writing in his journal- giving the show's moral while putting everything into perspective. In later years- Marsha graduated from law school and got her first job- while Kevin (and later- Heather) graduated from high school and entered college. The 1985 small-screen adaptation of "Mr. Belvedere" marked the end of a long succession of unsuccessful attempts to bring Davenport's novel to television; the three earlier pilots were made in the 1950s (soon after the final big-screen movie) and 1960s.,TV-G,Comedy- Family,6

During a fight between Sarah and Jesse- Sarah ends up at Ethan's house and tells Ethan's parents that she was asked to babysit instead. Ethan has a vision when touching Sarah- and notices she has no reflection in the mirror- leaving him suspicious of her. He confides this in his dorky best friend- Benny. Sarah leaves to get Erica back from the party- knowing the party is full of bloodthirsty vampires. Curious- the boys have Benny's grandmother watch over Jane while they follow Sarah. They see her feed on a rat and realize she is a vampire. Sarah quickly explains that she is only a fledgling- a vampire who has not drunk human blood. The three of them return home- where they are attacked by a vampire sent by Jesse. The vampire is subdued by Sarah and they head to the vampire party to save Erica and and their dimwitted friend- Rory. However- Erica has been bitten by Gord and later bites Rory. Ethan- Benny- and Sarah then battle the vampires and escape. The next day- Rory- now a full vampire after drinking human blood- informs Ethan and Benny that Jesse's gang are going to church so Ethan- Benny and Sarah follow them. Ethan has a vision in which he sees a gravestone- whose dates unscramble to the number 219- and a mysterious box- which is then uncovered by the vampires. The box is called the Cubile Animus or "Nest of Souls." Ethan and Sarah figure out Jesse's full plan from an old book- learning that in the original settlement of the town- there was a priest named Reverend Horace Black that led an evil vampire cult. The townspeople burned the cult members- leading to all "219" of their deaths during a lunar eclipse. In another vision- Ethan sees that Jesse is Horace Black- and plans to use the box to trap the souls of teens going to see a movie premiere to resurrect the souls of his ancient cult during the lunar eclipse occurring on that same night. Benny's grandmother- who reveals that she is an Earth Priestess- gives Ethan- Benny and Sarah enchanted daggers and a spellbook to defeat the vampires. She explains that Ethan sees visions because he is a Seer- which enables him to see visions through touch- and that Benny is a spellmaster- allowing him to cast spells. At the theater- the vampires begin to steal the souls of the teens- but are thwarted by Ethan- Benny and Sarah. Jesse escapes and Ethan and Benny follow in pursuit. In another vision- Ethan sees the tree he saw inside the old book- realizing it's the tree in his backyard- where they find Jesse. As the eclipse begins- Jesse attempts to hold Ethan and Benny down and resurrect the souls he already obtained from the Cubile Animus- but Sarah intervenes. When the box lands in Ethan's hands- he releases the vengeful souls that were captured- and they destroy Jesse. The next day- Ethan- Benny and Sarah head to school- meeting Erica and Rory- who have decided to live peacefully as vampires.,TV-PG,Action- Comedy- Fantasy- Horror,2

It took several tries before the life and work of James Thurber was successfully adapted into a weekly television series.

The sitcom starred William Windom as John Monroe [the character based on James Thurber] and featured a combination of live-action and animation. Despite many positive reviews- moderate Nielsen ratings led NBC to cancel the series after one season.

Its popularity was derived from its simple format and wacky action. Two couples- preselected from the studio audience- had to complete various stunts within a time limit (usually 60 seconds or less) to win cash and prizes. Examples of the often-messy stunts (the centerpiece of the show) included blowing a plastic ship carrying a ping-pong ball from one side of a water-filled tub to the other- without allowing the ball to fall off; stuffing eight balloons in a lidded wastebasket without breaking any; and extracting three marshmallows buried in Jell-O using a spoon held in his mouth- then placing each marshmallow on a plate next to them. A huge clock counted down the seconds- as host Collyer provided commentary and encouragement. Couples who successfully completed their stunt won cash (usually $100 to $200- depending on the round) and a prize. After the first round of stunts- each couple got a chance to complete an extra-difficult "bonus stunt" (e.g.- blowing a feather off a table and then catching it with a top hat while it was being worn) worth $100 plus $100 for each show it was not completed. During the big-money quiz-show era- the bonus prize stunt was worth $5-000 plus $1-000 for each show not completed. The format of "Beat the Clock" factored into countless stunt-related game shows in the years that followed; two "Beat the Clock" revivals also followed one in 1969 and another in 1979- both enlisting the aid of celebrity guests.,TV-G,Family- Game-Show,nan

HouseGuests are sequestered in the Big Brother House without contact with the outside world. Each week- the HouseGuests take part in several compulsory challenges that determine who will win food- luxuries- and opportunities to become the Head of Household (HoH) or win the Power of Veto (PoV). The winner of the weekly HoH competition is immune from nominations and nominates two fellow HouseGuests for eviction. The two HouseGuests nominated for eviction are also referred to as being "on the block" for eviction. After a HouseGuest becomes HoH- he or she is ineligible to take part in the next HoH competition. The winner of the PoV competition wins the right to save one of the nominated HouseGuests from eviction and take them off the block. If the PoV winner exercises the power- the HoH then nominates another HouseGuest to go up on the block for eviction. HouseGuests also take part in the Have vs. Have-Not competitions. Depending on their performance during the competitions- HouseGuests are divided into either the "Haves" or the "Have Nots." The Have Nots are restricted to eating "Big Brother Slop" and a couple of food items selected by the viewing public. They are also allowed to eat condiments and protein shakes. Have Nots are only allowed to take cold showers- and typically sleep on uncomfortable beds in a room with poor aesthetics. On Eviction Night- all HouseGuests- except for the HoH and the two nominees on the block- vote to evict one of the two nominees. This compulsory vote takes place in the Diary Room- where voting HouseGuests are asked by the show's host- Arisa Cox- whom they want to evict. In the event of a tie- the HoH casts the deciding vote- announcing it in front of the other HouseGuests,nan,Reality-TV,7

The house guests begin to introduce other people at the Big Brother house. It's the first time they will get to know each other and they're not allowed to say not one word with them until they are in the Big Brother house. The thirteen will be living in the same house for the following two months. They may either find their best friend or worst enemy in that group; and in the end- it's one men for themselves. Then- contestants who have performed their stunts were asked to vote for the person who should be kicked out of the house (which happens to be the loser)- and the guest with the most votes- is the loser and will be evicted from the Big Brother household. However- if the participant wins his/her stunts- then the player will be named "Head of the Household-" for a day. The guest who stays in the house longer than anybody else does wins $500-000.,TV-14,Game-Show- Reality-TV,22

A single contestant competed against a team of two (related in some way but not married) to answer general knowledge questions- which allowed them to claim hexagonal boxes on a large five-by-four game board if they answered correctly. Each box had a different letter of the alphabet on it- and each question had a one-word answer beginning with whichever letter was selected by a player. The single contestant had to complete a vertical path on the board to win (a minimum of four red boxes)- while the two-person team had to finish a horizontal path on the board (a minimum of five white boxes). Oftentimes- more than the minimum number of boxes were required to win a game. The first team to win a two-out-of-three-game match became the champion and played the "Gold Rush" for a chance to win $5-000 in cash. The same game board was used only with each box having one letter or as much as five initials to a phrase- title- name- etc. The champion- whether it be the single player or one member of the two-person team- had 60 seconds to make a horizontal connection across the board. Each clue answered correctly turned the box in question gold- while incorrect answers or passes turned a box black- making it a block that a contestant had to work around. If the champion failed to make such connection- he/she won $100 per correct answer. Teams continued until winning 10 games or being defeated. The 10-game maximum was eventually extended to 20 games- allowing previously-retired champions to be brought back to the show.,TV-G,Game-Show,1

But it was also the age of Machievelli- of rampant lawlessness- incessant war and unspeakable depravity. At the heart of the world order was the Vatican- the arbiter of conflicts between kingdoms and empires. And at the center of the Vatican was a man whose quest for power would propel him to seek the ultimate prize- the holy see of Rome. He was a man whose name would become synonymous with ruthlessness- and whose reign as pope would be remembered as the most infamous chapter of the history of the Catholic church -Rodrigo Borgia. His four children -Juan- the oldest- a prideful- lazy- unscrupulous sexual predator- Cesare- a young man torn between a faith that was not his calling and his dark violent nature- Lucretia- a young girl discovering the secret power that a women's sexuality holds- and Goffredo- an innocent child who would come of age in a family riven by conflict- would provide Rodrigo with a challenge as great as the political maneuvering of his political and religious rivals. "Borgia" is a one hour dramatic series that chronicles the rise to power of this Spanish Cardinal and his clan- who would seek to establish a dynasty that would hold sway over the entire world. Though a man of faith- Rodrigo was also in thrall to the pleasures of the flesh. Not only did he have to deal with the plotting and conspiracies of his fellow cardinals and the representatives of the great powers- but he was locked in a struggle to contain the bitter sibling rivalries that threatened to tear his family apart. "Borgia" is a cauldron of intrigue- violence- murder- lust- politics- faith- incest- betrayal and redemption- a story as compelling and enlightening as the age in which it takes place.,TV-MA,Biography- Drama- History,3

Coach D is a strong woman- with a no-nonsense personality- and drives the girls under her to be the best they can be. Still- she has a human side- and she does care about the girls- and tries to be supportive of them (something we don't see too often in another- well-known dance reality show).

April- the 12th- 1861 and the attack on the northern fortress Fort Sumter done by the southerners means the beginning of war.

Initial storylines focused on adultery- drug use- frigidity- rape- gossip- homosexuality- marriage problems- racism. The building's ground floor delicatessen run by Hungarian Jew Aldo Godolfus and the nearby laundrette provided central meeting places for characters. Original residents included busty blonde virgin Bev Houghton who fell in love with her neighbour- homosexual lawyer Don Finlayson. Don's flatmate lover was Bruce Taylor- a photographer who was secretly being kept financially by his employer- the bitchy and sardonic Maggie Cameron. Friendly Vera Collins read tarot cards for a living; her husband had deserted her and she would be perpetually unlucky in love. In flat 8 lived immigrants from Lancashire- whining Alf Sutcliffe and his salt of the earth wife Lucy- who worked in the laundrette. Interfering- malaproping gossip Dorrie Evans was the building's self-appointed "conserge"; her husband was the more friendly Herb. Lovable rogue and ladies man Jack Sellars romanced Bev- Aldo had the problems of his rebellious daughter Rose before she got married and moved away- and Aldo's new wife Roma Lubinski joined him in his comedy attempts to use modern Australian idiom. Also coming to work at the deli was new resident- the bookish young Arnold Feather. A wine bar opened in the building- run by bubbly Norma Whittaker. She and her amateur inventor husband Les moved in to live in flat 1. Camp young movie fan Dudley Butterfield arrived to work in the wine bar- and Dorrie's old friend and now lodger was the no-nonsense Flo Patterson: a perfect foil for snobbish Dorrie. Maggie Cameron later became part owner of the building- frequently making unsuccessful attempts to evict the residents. The regimented Reg "Daddy" McDonald- has dizzy wife Edie "Mummy" McDonald and their ebullient daughter Marilyn later moved in the flat 5. An early storyline was the dreaded 'knicker snipper'- a devious intruder who ransacked the women's bedrooms and cut holes in their panties and bras. Later comedy storylines were added- while 1974 saw more crime with the horrific panty-hose strangler killing off two young women residents- and attacking one other. 1975 saw four major stars killed off in the infamous bomb-blast episode: a failed attempt to boost the show's by then declining ratings. Australia's first full frontal nude scene was added during the later episodes in 1977 but nevertheless- ratings waned and the series eventually ended- with Dorrie- Herb and Don the only original characters still around at the end.,nan,Comedy- Crime- Drama- Mystery- Romance,1

If they get three incorrect answers- then the cab pulls over and they are dropped off wherever they are. They lose any money they would have won. The first four questions are worth $25 each- the next four questions are worth $50- and any question thereafter are worth $100. If a contestant has won more than $200 and the cab is forced to stop at a traffic light- the driver will start a Red Light Challenge. The driver will read a question that has multiple correct answers (usually five or more)- and the passenger will then have 30 seconds to give a designated number of those answers (usually all five). Doing so is worth an additional $250 to the fare- and failure to answer the question will not count as a strike- so there is no risk. The passenger is allowed two "Shout-Outs" during the course of the trip- and each type can be used only once. The first type is the Mobile Shout-Out- in which the contestant is allotted a phone call to a friend by means of the driver's cell phone. The player is allowed to ask their friend the question and acquire what they think is the correct answer- however- there is a 30 second time limit. The other is the Street Shout-Out. If the passenger chooses to use this one- the driver will stop at the first person he sees and will let the fare ask the person the question and what they think the correct answer is- but there is no time limit for this question. Although there is no time limit- often times the pedestrian does not know the answer. Should the passenger reach the destination- the driver offers the passenger a choice. The passenger has the option of keeping the prize money and leaving the cab- or the choice of answering a final- more difficult- visual question that- if answered correctly- doubles the fare's winnings. However- if the passenger chooses to answer the final question and provides an incorrect answer- the game show host keeps all the money the passenger won previously.

Hosted by Bob Keeshan (at one time- he played Howdy Doody's friend- Clarabell) from the appropriately-named Captain's Place- the Captain was so named because he always wore an overcoat with large- kangaroo-like pouches. Each show featured stories- skits- vaudeville acts- songs- games and other educational activities. Captain Kangaroo's friends were Mr. Green Jeans (who always brought an animal to the show); Dennis- an apprentice handyman and do-it-all person; and Mr. Moose and Bunny Rabbit. Bunny was always mute- but made his point ever-so-cleverly- while Mr. Moose always tricked the Captain into allowing him to stand under a shower of pingpong balls. As the show got on in years- new features were added- including Uncle Backwards (a tape of some simple action- such as peeling an orange or building a doghouse- shown in reverse); "Picture Pages-" a matching activity hosted by Bill Cosby; and Slim Goodbody- which taught children about health- nutrition and physical fitness. Many actors- actresses and singers guest starred. In the early 1980s- new formats were attempted- all without success including the early morning "Wake Up with the Captain" (which starred new puppet friends and employed the joke-of-the-day); by 1984- the show ended its 29-year CBS run. During the early 1990s- Bob Keeshan hosted a daily series airing on PBS; it featured clips from the classic program along with new footage.,TV-G,Family,26

Jeremy- who is in love with Aelita- struggles through season 1 to find a way to "materialize" Aelita- so she can become human by exiting the scanners that connect Odd- Ulrich- and Yumi to Lyoko. If Jeremy accomplishes this- he will be able to shut down Lyoko and defeat XANA. We witness Jeremy finally materializes Aelita- and accomplish his dream. The group deactivate Lyoko- but XANA apparently infected Aelita with a virus before she was materialized so that if XANA goes- she does too! In the beginning of season 2- we witness the dawn of new technology. Jeremy programs vehicles into Lyoko for faster travel and makes a better scan program to detect "activated towers"- so Aelita can live on Earth without having to stay in Lyoko to look out for XANA's attacks on Earth! ALong with that- Jeremy announces that he is working on an antivirus good enough to save Aelita from XANA! Franz Hopper- a brilliant scientist- seems related to Aelita after some research.

Colbert will pepper commentaries with phrases like- "Look- I don't have time to read books-" or- "President Bush isn't a head thinker- he's a gut thinker." Aspects of talking head programs are exaggerated and Colbert presents a host overwhelmed by his own importance. Guests do not walk on-stage but are seated at a small table to the side. Colbert runs over to them- encouraging the audience to applaud and high five him as he passes. He is then likely to begin an interview by asking a guest something like- "Explain evolution in 20 seconds-" or "Isn't everyone who disagrees with the president guilty of treason?" Colbert is also very clear about our number one threat- "Bears." His distrust of bears is a continuing theme.,TV-14,Comedy- News- Talk-Show,11

Each contestant called out a pair of numbers on the board which contained the names of prizes- humorous joke prizes and WILD and action cards (the latter three explained later). No match passed control to the opponent- but a match gave whatever prize was printed on the card or allowed him to perform an action- revealed two pieces of the rebus (identifying a person- phrase- place- thing- etc.) and allowed him/her a chance to solve the rebus. WILD cards provided an automatic match- while TAKE cards allowed the contestant at that moment to snatch a prize his/her opponent might have in their possession. A FORFEIT card meant the player immediately had to give up one of the prizes he/she had in his possession. The joke prizes (things such as a banana peel- a button- etc.) actually served as insurance markers against opponents TAKE cards and the FORFEIT cards he/she might stumble upon. Only upon correctly solving the rebus does a player actually win what he/she claimed from the board; the loser forfeits all his gifts. Originally- there was no bonus game; later in the run came "The Envelope and its Mysterious Contents" (which hid cash amounts or a prize such as a car)- and still later- "The Cash Wheel" which allowed a player to win up to $2-000 cash. Champions continued until either defeated or by winning 20 games; the top winners each season returned to play a "Tournament of Champions." During the original run of "Concentration-" the show reportedly gave away 512 cars- 397 boats- 1-287 domestic and foreign trips and cruises- 12 trips around the world- 857 fur coats and numerous diamonds not to mention all the travel trailers- airplanes- swimming pools- furniture and countless other items (one history on the show reported the total prize giveaway at $10 million).,TV-G,Game-Show,1

The five are: Chuck Taggart - a charismatic authoritative and stoic mission commander and former ace pilot- Kurt Mendel - a likable pompous horny quip-prone British science author and NASA's special celebrity guest on the flight who actually does know a lot about science and can be brave and cunning despite claiming otherwise- Neil Taggart - Chuck's young adult son and genuine computer expert- Sarah Forbes - a popular news anchor and TV reporter who's there to make an exclusive piece about the mission- and Angela Perry - Chuck's experienced co-pilot who's father is a powerful senator. Everything is going fine until the Earth is suddenly caught on fire and then implodes for no apparent reason. This horrifying mysterious event damages the crew's shuttle- which leads to the death of the technician and also leaves Angela badly hurt and unconscious. Just before their oxygen runs out- the crew is saved by a friendly alien AI construct- who calls himself the Seeker and who's been investigating similar planetary destructions for some time now. Since each destroyed planet was home to a developing civilization like human on Earth- the Seeker believes that someone or something is intentionally causing these catastrophes to happen with the goal of eradicating sentient life entirely. He asks the crew for help and they agree. The Seeker sends their consciousnesses through time and they all wake up on Earth five years in the past. This gives them the chance to find out who or what caused the destruction of Earth and stop it. However- the fact that they know the future and that they act on this knowledge causes slight changes and some things happen differently- which sometimes proves to be beneficial but at other times leads to tragedy. They also have new problems in their personal lives. Chuck can't convince his wife that he's seen the future- which jeopardizes their marriage. Also- his other son Marc tries to impress him by trying to become an astronaut despite the fact that he hates the job. Kurt tries to use his knowledge of the future for his personal benefit but it backfires. Neil is now a teenager again and has to go back to high school. Also- his girlfriend is now underage as well which makes things a bit awkward for him. Sarah's little son has died from cancer in the original timeline- so she does all she can to prevent this from happening this time. However- her obsession causes her husband at the time to think that she's insane and potentially dangerous for the boy. On the other hand- Sarah has to deal with the fact that her future husband is now just one of her coworkers- who's still with his future ex. Angela's ability to perform her duty is questioned after an accident caused by the time travel and there's danger that she won't be on the Odyssey mission in five years if she fails her psych test. Also- her father may or may not be somehow involved with what happens to Earth. The crew's favorite hangout place is a nice quiet local diner where they can consult one another and plan their next moves or simply unwind. They soon finds evidence of a major conspiracy but they'll have to dig much deeper to determine who's behind it- what it's goals are and whether or not it actually has anything to do with the future destruction of Earth. Their only clew is the word Leviathan that showed up on their shuttle's monitor just before Earth's destruction and suspects include human conspirators within NASA and the US government- powerful mysterious AI beings called Sentients and possibly even aliens. Due to cancellation- the show ends on an unresolved cliffhanger but some answers are given.,nan,Action- Adventure- Drama- Mystery- Sci-Fi- Thriller,1

But if the successfully complete the stunt- they then vote off one of the people who voted for them. Players are whittled down until only two remain. They then compete in a head to head competition to discover who's the Top Dog. But it's not over yet! The Top Dog then gets five question categories (ie: Sports- Politics- Entertainment) and must choose which player from the Dog Pound they want to answer each one. If the Top Dog chooses wisely and manages to get the pound members to answer three incorrectly- he/she wins the pot of $25-000. But if the Pound members answer three correctly- they split the pot equalling $5-000 apiece. The game's a great one because during the evaluation day- players use lies and deceit to fool fellow players into thinking they're weak in areas they may not be.

At the beginning of each show- the two teams (each with such names as "Wacky Wormheads" or "Slimy Superkids") competed in a physical challenge (described below). The winner of the physical challenge would gain control of the first round questions. Host Summers asked the question- to which the team could answer for $10 or "dare" (i.e.- challenge) the opposing team to answer for $20. However- the opponents could "double dare" (ergo- challenge back) the original team to answer; the original team could then answer for $40 or complete a "physical challenge-" an often messy stunt that had to be completed within 10- 15- 20- or 30 seconds. "Physical challenge" stunts could include one team member wrapping his/her partner in a giant "tortilla shell" and drop hot sauce on it; having to throw three balloons filled with fingerpaint at a target- while having to select from a tub that also had water balloons inside; and catapulting condiments onto a giant hamburger while the partner held the bun and patty. Completing the physical challenge was worth $20; however- losing the physical challenge meant the other team got the money and control of the questions. The opposing team also got control of the questions if the other team answered incorrectly (as well as the cash if the question was dared or double-dared).

The team with the most money after two rounds won and advanced to the Double Dare Obstacle Course- a series of eight often very messy obstacles the team had to clear within 60 seconds to win a grand prize. Each team member alternated duties- but each time- the object was to retrieve a flag and hand it to his/her partner. Each flag was worth a prize- and if the team retrieved all eight flags- they won a grand prize (usually a trip).

The Pacific is in parts a fast paced war series that can be enjoyed by action lovers whilst containing a more sensitive side when projecting the relationships (brotherhood) of Marines on the battlefield. Where The Pacific takes a new direction from its "older brother" is in its depiction of the lives of soldiers who were picked to return home to increase the sales of war bonds. In doing this it also depicts the life cycle of returned soldiers from initial joy to the eventual feeling of regret and to a certain extent shame felt by soldiers wanting to return to the war in service of either their comrades or nation.,TV-MA,Action- Adventure- Drama- History- War,1

No less attention is paid to the relationships between all these hotshots (some change during the series)- young and ambitious- sexy and horny- so there's lots of temptation- amorous and professional rivalry- conflicting personal and professional interests.

When there are four or fewer contestants remaining- a correct answer allows that contestant to choose who to pass the buck to- and the last contestant to pass the back has to give the first answer to the next question. The final two contestants go head to head by being asked a number of questions for which they alternate in giving answers- with each contestant scoring one point for every correct answer. When a contestant gives the last possible correct answer- known as a "lockout"- or the buck stops with them- the next question goes to their opponent.

However- both the girls and their two cliques slowly grow together and become an unlikely group of friends with both typical and not so typical high school and young adult problems. Brooke McQueen is the captain of Glamazons- the school's cheerleading squad. She's considered smart- beautiful and perfect. Privately- she's been dealing with self-image and body image issues ever since her estranged mother left her and her father. She also tries to fight the popular image people have of her. She wants to be good and does good and often helps people instead of thinking only about herself but she also has a suppressed selfish side. Sam McPherson aims to have the opposite image of Brooke's. She's attracted to journalism and wants to be the voice of nonconformists. Despite this- she has several flaws like being too judgmental- underestimating people or ignoring the fact that she sometimes acts hypocritically- especially when it comes to love. Her anger partially stems from the trauma of losing her father to leukemia. Lily Esposito is the schools top environmentalist- animal and human rights activist and an all-around liberal On the other hand- she has a fear of sex and sexuality and this creates problems in her relationships with men. She's Sam's friend and so is Harrison John- the ultimate friend-zoned guyfriend- who's been friends with both Brooke and Sam for a long time and has a crush on Brooke ever since childhood but also feels certain attraction to Sam. These three friends make the ultimate love triangle. Carmen Ferrara is a slightly overweight girl- who tries to deal with her body issues by trying to accept and enjoy who she is. Despite being friends with Sam's group- her dream is to become one of the Glamazons and be friends with the popular girls as well and she goes for it. Josh Ford is the school's hot popular quarterback- who at first seems like a walking jock stereotype but actually has a lot of depth and is for the most part a nice guy. He dates Brooke at first and they become the school's ultimate power couple but he eventually decides to quit trying to be what other people want him to be and become his own man. Nicole Julian is the second in command of Glamazons but always wants more power and influence. She's assertive- smart- cynical- egotistical- Machiavellian- combative and attractive and she knows it. She sees herself as the Queen B of the school and wants everyone to know it and respect it. She does not play fair and wants to see all her real and perceived enemies destroyed. The only people she respects are Gwyneth Paltrow and for the most part Brooke. However- she sometimes shows her suppressed empathic side and in those moments she becomes a true friend. Michael 'Sugar Daddy' Bernardino is Josh's towering best friend. He's cheerful- fun- acts like a rapper- takes the simple approach to life but also suffers from morbid obesity. He doesn't let this bother him though and uses his size to his advantage when playing football with Josh for the school's team. Mary Cherry is Nicole's larger than life- super rich- both genuinely quirky and amusingly psychotic- best friend and a Glamazon- although Nicole usually treats her like her sidekick. Jane McPherson is Sam's loving mom. Mike McQueen is Brooke's loving dad. The two meet and fall in love which eventually leads to marriage. Brooke and Sam can't accept this and even do their best to try to break them up but the girls eventually see the upside of becoming stepsisters- which doesn't stop them from occasionally stabbing each other in the back. Bobbi Glass is the gang's conservative- androgynous- charismatic- ingenious- commanding- tyrannical female biology- science and chemistry teacher and a true frienemy who always comes up with creative ways to put her students down but she also has a somewhat of an empathic side to her. She has several twin brothers and sisters. April Tuna is the school's scary unhinged psychotic nerdy ginger with a potent sex drive- but boys avoid her nonetheless. She leads the actual unpopular kids from the fringes of high school society and has her eye on Harrison. Emory Dick is Harrison's self-confident geeky friend who doesn't even try to fit in and likes it that way. He's always ready to help his friends and often comes up with silly creative plans that sometime actually make things worse. Poppita Fresh is the African American Glamazon and fits in perfectly with Nicole and Mary Cherry. George Austin is a smart- nice- hot- and caring African American jock- who falls for Sam and she reciprocates. Freddy Gong is the school's uneasy Asian American student- who has a strange masochistic rapport with Nicole. Principal Cecilia Hall is the school's caring blind principal who always tries to be just and help the students as well as protect the school's interests. Vice-Principal Calvin Krupps arrives later to help the school deal with conflicts between students. He's a very smart man- who doesn't mind playing games or confronting students openly if he believes that some good will come of it. Principal Hall eventually disappears from the show and he becomes the schools acting principal and he and Ms. Glass become buds. Godfrey is Ms. Glass' very strange on and off boyfriend who eventually becomes a priest. Cherry Cherry is Mary Cherry's super rich super charismatic no-nonsense mother and businesswoman who talks tough and acts accordingly. Her dream is to marry the real life actor Erik Estrada and when she wants something- she means business. The show's plots- arcs and subplots range from creative quirky over the top parodies to enhanced reality situations and typical high school drama. Due to unforeseen cancellation- the show ends on a huge cliffhanger.,TV-14,Comedy- Drama- Romance,2

The game consisted of two rounds- each with two parts. In the first part of each round- host Tomarken read a toss-up question; the first to signal is given a chance to answer. That response- plus two other possible answers are then listed- with the other two contestant then given a chance to choose from the three listed answers. A correct answer earned the first contestant three spins and his/her opponents one spin each. Four such questions were played; the players used the spins to accumulate cash and prizes on an 18-space board. One contestant at a time is in control of the board; he/she stopped a randomly-flashing cursor by pressing his signal device (and usually the scream "STOP!"). The contestant wins whatever appears in the lit space a cash amount- a prize- perhaps an extra spin or other action space ... or it could be a Whammy- which caused the contestant to lose all he/she had accumulated in that game. The Whammy was an animated devil who starred in the sequences- which played when a contestant lost his winnings. As long as a contestant is in control of the board- he/she can continue to press their luck and possibly lose their accumulated winnings on the next spin or elect to pass his/her remaining spins to an opponent (the leader or the player in second place- depending on who passes)- meaning he/she must use those spins. Any player who lands on four whammies is eliminated from the game; the high scorer after two rounds is the winner and returns. Only the winner keeps what he/she had won; a player continued until winning five shows- until defeated or winning $25-000 (later $50-000- then the winnings limit at CBS). The most famous contestant on "Press Your Luck" was Michael Larson- who memorized the flashing patterns of the gameboard cursor. Putting his knowledge to use- he racked $110-000 in cash and prizes during his 1984 appearance on the show (which was broken into a two-part show); the game was soon redesigned by the producers to prevent future fortune-hunting gameplay. For years- "Press Your Luck" reruns aired on the USA Network; Game Show Network was scheduled to begin airing reruns of the show starting in September 2001. "Press Your Luck" was based on the 1977 game show- "Second Chance-" which was largely identical to the later game show.,TV-G,Family- Game-Show,2

As the family's emergency adult while his parents are working- he's responsible for taking care of his younger brother Drew (Tequan Richmond)- who's taller and more confident than Chris- and sister Tonya (Imani Hakim)- who gets all the parents' attention. Chris' rough- cost-conscious father Julius (Terry Crews) works numerous jobs to properly support his family. Sassy mom Rochelle (Tichina Arnold) runs the household on a tight budget- is very strict- and works part-time in a small real estate office. With his mom determined to see him in a good school- though Drew and Tonya go to the same school in their old neighborhood- Chris reluctantly faces multiple bus transfers every day to attend Corleone Junior High in the fiercely Italian neighborhood- South Shore. Despite being an immediate target for bullies- Chris' innate charm and sharp wit enable him to make new friends- like Greg (Vincent Martella)- another smart- nice kid... who can't fight- by the way. As Chris Rock pointedly looks back- his younger self is set to find what his family already knows: Chris' sharp- scrappy character is going to take him places. But first- he's going to have to think- talk- or run his way through one growing experience after another at home and school... and on any number of buses along the way.,TV-PG,Comedy,4

Max Evans- Isabel Evans and Michael Guerin are teenage humans with extraordinary gifts - gifts that are "not-of-this-earth". They are human/alien hybrids- sent here to complete their destiny. Their counterparts have already perished in a war of attrition- thus one day- they will return to their home planet and save their race. Before a fateful day in 1999- the teens hid their gifts. The event that forever changed their lives was when Max healed Liz Parker (a classmate) after she was fatally shot in the stomach in a dispute between two customers at the restaurant where she waitresses. A close relationship then develops between Max and Liz. Central to the first season were the relationships between the hybrids and their human companions.

Leonard,Martin Milner- George Maharis- Glenn Corbett,USA,English,series,Only fiction series written & shot all over North America. Two young adventurers in a Corvette explore early 60's social problems and changing mores- looking for the right place to settle down while seeking themselves. Debuting 3 years after "On the Road" transformed modern literature- while such newly available fast cars dominated the new teenage culture- Tod- an Ivy Leaguer- and Buz- an orphan from Hell's Kitchen- cruise the U.S.A. coping with shifting relationships and lifestyles. The FCC's Newton Minow characterized U.S. TV as a "vast wasteland-" in 1961- but "Route 66" found important- compelling stories all over. Sterling Silliphant who won an Oscar for writing "In the Heat of the Night-" traveled around the U.S. and Canada scouting locales- while writing ¾ of the very dark- literate show's episodes - a feat only Rod Serling matched with The Twilight Zone. Soon- a crew of 50 arrived at the location. Shows were filmed in 40 States. Tod- from a once-wealthy family- inherited only a Corvette when his father died- so he and Buz (suddenly jobless because he worked for Tod's father's company) strike out across North America- especially along the iconic Route 66 from Chicago to L.A. which the Okies traveled. Tod and Buz take local jobs (such as shrimping- shipbuilding- oil rigging) to support their wanderings. The 2 socially conscious knights of the road- encourage- champion- and learn from oppressed and troubled people they encounter. 1962 guest star Ethel Waters was the first African-American woman nominated for an Emmy Award. The CBS show doubled Corvette sales its first season. Tod and Buz's beige Corvette's 2 seats meant "sans souci" and constant movement- so shows were shot in 6 days- in a new city almost every week. The two drifters reject the post-war American Dream of the suburbs- while exploring a disappearing North America with very diverse local culture- not yet dominated by international franchises and cookie-cutter suburbs. The shows' vibrate with the new dreams for a Great Society and the fears of the Cold War. The volatile Buz Murdock was cast quickly- while Martin Milner beat out Robert Redford for the Tod Stiles role. Due to hepatitis- Maharis did not appear in the series' last 1 ½ seasons. The show grew from a pilot on creator Silliphant and Route 66 producer Herbert B. Leonard's "Naked City-" also shot on location. Naked City and Route 66 bridged the widely varied anthologies and live plays of the 1950's Golden Age of Television- to the much cheaper- 1 hour dramatic- set-character based series- which continue to rule prime-time. Nelson Riddle's atmospheric Theme from Route 66- and his episode scores factored heavily in the show's allure. The breezy song Route 66- written by Bobby Troup (of the 1970's TV series "Emergency !")- a 1946 Nat King Cole hit- wasn't used for the series. A sequel to Route 66 appeared in 1993- but lasted only 4 episodes.,nan,Adventure,4

Each night ABC would begin a summation of the days events in Iran immediately after the local news. Koppel's show became a permanent fixture- and was expanded to a full hour. Rather than start the show on Fridays at 12:30am- ABC tried to move the show to primetime- at 8pm- and on a different day of the week- no less!

Six contestants (three choosers and three "potential partners") are paired off and head to their own isolation booth. After spotting the teams $200- host Kennedy reads a series of multiple-choice questions- each worth $500. Both team members had to agree on an answer; after reviewing the guesses- Kennedy revealed the correct answer and announced the winnings. After four questions- the team with the least amount of money (or- in case of a tie- who took the longest time answering) are eliminated from the game ... but not until they head to the Trust Box to divide their winnings. That's where the fun (and oftentimes- shenanigans) begins. Each team member made a brief statement to their partner on why he/she should vote "Friend" and split the money. The contestants then made their decision- via hidden buttons on their side of the Trust Box. If both voted "Friend-" they evenly split the money; if they each voted "Foe-" they forfeited the whole thing. But if one voted "Friend" and the other went "Foe-" the "Foe" kept everything and their "friend" disappointed- to put it mildly. A second round of four questions was played with the remaining teams- with questions worth $1-000 and the lowest-scoring team to that point eliminated after a visit to the Trust Box. The last remaining team advanced to the speed round- where they teamed to answer up to 10 questions (at $500 apiece) within 60 seconds. Three wrong answers stopped the game- but if they answered all 10 questions correctly- their pot is doubled. Then it's one last visit to the Trust Box- where they decide if they want to keep it all- hog it for themselves or blow the whole thing.,nan,Family- Game-Show,nan

Fred Sanford is a cantankerous 65-year-old- black- widowed junk dealer living in Los Angeles' Watts neighborhood. Helping him is his restless son- 34-year-old Lamont; Fred's beloved wife and Lamont's mother- Elizabeth- had died more than 20 years earlier. Fred's schemes and bigotry especially toward Julio- a Puerto Rican who was Lamont's friend- whites and other minorities often frustrated Lamont. Fred also showed overt disdain for his sister-in-law- Aunt Esther (the feeling was mutual). Many times- Lamont threatened to leave for meaningful work- but Fred faked a heart attack each time ("Oh- this time its real- I'm a-comin' 'Lizabeth!") as a sympathy ploy to get his son to stay. By 1977- Fred and Lamont had sold their business (stars Foxx and Wilson wanted to leave the series); it became the Sanford Arms- a rooming house. The show continued as the short-lived "Sanford Arms" (without Foxx or Wilson); it was revived in 1980 on CBS as "Sanford" (starring Foxx and without Wilson).,TV-PG,Comedy,6

Host Clark announced a category (e.g.- something found in a refrigerator); the team chosen to go first were given a letter (e.g.- S) and had 20 seconds to list up to six items in that category- with each response worth 1 point. The opposing team could then challenge any of the responses for any reason; if a majority of the jury (a gallery composed of 12 former contestants) agreed- that answer was deleted and 1 point deducted from the score. Then- the pre-taped answers from five celebrities were played. The team earned 2 points if the celebrity gave a different answer- while they lost 2 points if the celebrity's answer was the same. After play finished on that question- the other team played the same category using a different letter. A second round- with double point values- was played with a new category. The team leading at the end of the second round won $500 and played a bonus round. In the bonus round- a new category was announced and five letters shown; the team had 25 seconds to list 10 words- two words for each letter. Each celebrity's pre-taped response was played; if at least three celebrities gave different responses than those given by the team of contestants- the team won a cash bonus (which began at $4-000 and increased by $1-000 per show until claimed); otherwise- the team won $200 per celebrity not matched.,nan,Family- Game-Show,1

The town's long history of strange disappearances and ghost and monster sightings form the basis for its thriving tourist industry- and as such- the gang's parents and some people (mostly Mayor Fred Jones Sr. and Sheriff Bronson Stone) are not happy that their children are debunking all the supernatural goings-on that bring in so much revenue as the overwrought schemes of charlatans and criminals. In addition to the traditional cases they always solve- the team finds itself being nudged into the uncovering of a dark secret that is hidden in the past of Crystal Cove- covered up by parties unknown. The new Mystery Incorporated is following cryptic hints from a faceless mystery-man known only as "Mr. E". The new Mystery Incorporated is unearthing the legend of a cursed Conquistador treasure- the secret history of Crystal Cove's founding Darrow Family- and the mysterious- unsolved case involving four mystery-solving youths and their pet-the original Mystery Incorporated. Standing in the way of their solving this mystery- however- are the romantic entanglements pulling the kids apart: Shaggy finds himself unable to put his new romance with Velma ahead of his longtime friendship with Scooby- while Daphne pines for a trap-obsessed Fred- who obliviously struggles to realize he shares her feelings too. As they investigate further the mystery about the curse of Crystal Cove- they discover that a creature known as "The Freak of Crystal Cove" threatens and stalks anyone who comes near the haunted treasure. They uncover the Freak's true identity to be Mayor Fred Jones Sr. who reveals that Fred's true parents are Brad and Judy from the original Mystery- Inc. In the aftermath- Fred goes off to find his real parents and breaks his engagement with Daphne- declaring that "Mystery- Inc. is dead". Shaggy's parents send Shaggy to a military academy and Scooby-Doo to a farm.

The game was revised and brought to television in 1984 by Reg Grundy Productions. Two contestants competed in the "crossword" round- played on a giant Scrabble board. Host Woolery announces a letter to build on- announces the number of letters in the word and reads a clue to said word (e.g.- a seven letter word; "Experts really know how to pick them"; answer: "pockets"). The contestant chosen to go first draws two numbered tiles from the rack; the rack (positioned between the contestants) contained all the letters in the word- plus three "stoppers-" or letters not in the puzzle. The contestant indicates which letter he wants to place in the word; if the letter fits- he/she may either attempt to guess the word or place another letter in the puzzle (the contestant draws two more tiles if he/she still doesn't attempt a guess). If the letter tried is a "stopper" or the contestant gives an incorrect solution- control passes to the opponent; letters landing on blue or pink squares were worth cash bonuses if they correctly guessed the word (#500 and #1-000 respectively- which the players kept regardless if they won the game). Play on the current word continues until all three "stoppers" are found (at which time a "speedword" format was used) or until one letter remained in the puzzle. The contestant who guesses the word correctly wins one point; all subsequent words were built on a letter in the previous word. The first player to win three points won the game- #500 and played the Sprint Round. In the Sprint Round- the contestant played vs. the returning champion to guess a given number of words in a shorter time period than the opponent. Either way- the "speedword" format was used- with Woolery giving the number of letters in the word and a clue. The contestant was shown two letters at a time; there were no "stoppers" in the Sprint Round- though a 10-second penalty was assessed for incorrect guesses. The winner of the Sprint Round received a cash bonus (usually #1-000)- returns as champion and played the Bonus Sprint against the clock. In the Bonus Sprint- the contestant had to guess two words- again under the "speedword" format- within 10 seconds to win #5-000 (plus #1-000 for each day it was not won); an incorrect guess at any point stopped the game. Champions continued until their defeat or until winning 10 Sprint Rounds. The rules o both the crossword and Sprint rounds changed several times during the show's run- most commonly relating to bonuses and the Sprint Round formats and how returning champions were determined; the above plot summary indicates the most enduring format.,nan,Game-Show,nan

Two married couples competed in this game- which combined elements of "The Price is Right" and "Beat the Clock." Each team participated in two rounds of stunts- many of them timed; the couple chosen to go first could- after hearing a description of the stunt- either perform the stunt or pass it to the opposing team- with the understanding they were required to perform the next stunt. The stunts involved such things as pop culture- shopping at the mall and "Beat the Clock"-style stunts (such as filling three balloons with whipped cream and stuffing them in his/her partner's pants). Two rounds of stunts were played- with the first stunt worth 100 points and the second 200 points; the couple also got to select a prize from one of the on-stage stores for winning their stunt. One of the stores also had a mini vacation known as the "Shopper's Special." The third round was the "Shopper's Challenge-" a 90-second series of rapid-fire questions relating to shopping and pop culture- the men and women alternate answering questions- with correct answers worth 50 points each. The team with the most points after the "Shopper's Challenge" won and played the bonus round. In the bonus round- one team member serves as the buyer and the other the runner. The couple is shown a series of six gifts- revealed one at a time; the buyer must decide whether to keep the gift or exchange it for a gift they thought was more expensive. If the buyer rejects the gift- the runner must take it to any one of the stores and exchange it for the unknown item waiting there. If the buyer wants to keep the item- the runner runs it to a table on the opposite side of the stage and hits a bell.

Is there a greater force at work in our world- guiding us along and connecting our lives? Laura- a grieving single mother- begins the chain. Next is Whitney- the self-made success story who thinks her boyfriend is cheating. Move on to Steven- the artist/photographer who believes he's lost his "eye."

Two children aged 7 to 10- one competing as X and the other O competed for an entire show; the nine celebrities were dressed as famous historical (e.g.- Paul Revere)- literature (e.g.- Robinson Crusoe) or characters from popular TV shows (e.g.- Capt. James T. Kirk of "Star Trek"). The game rules were identical to the daily show (i.e.- host Marshall reads a chosen celebrity a question- celebrity quip- agree or disagree). Each game was worth a $100 savings bond- which matured on the child's 18th birthday- plus a prize (e.g.- a color television set- dance lessons). The child winning the most games at the end of the show won a larger prize (e.g.- a family trip to Grand Canyon); however- even the child who lost was guaranteed a $100 savings bond and a prize. Though "Storybook Squares" lasted only a single season on the Saturday morning schedule- special children's weeks (utilizing a best-of-three match and everyone's a winner rules) were played throughout the NBC daytime run. Joan Rivers- a frequent guest on the show (and on the regular 'Hollywood Squares') said that one of the reasons 'Storybook Squares' didn't work was they spent what felt like 10 to 15 minutes just introducing the characters- which made the show difficult to make.,TV-G,Family- Game-Show,1

These creatures existed as stone in the day- but become flesh and blood at night. One Scottish clan made an alliance with humans to help protect a castle by night if the humans would protect their stone forms by day. The uneasy alliance was shattered when human prejudice provoked a betrayal that allowed the castle to be sacked and most of the resident clan destroyed- leaving only six adult survivors and a rookery of unhatched eggs. A further misunderstanding during the clan's retaliation on the invaders and rescue of their hostages left the clan frozen in stone by a magic spell that would only be broken when the "castle rises above the clouds." For a thousand years- the castle laid abandoned and the clan condemned by this curse. In 1994- a wealthy multibillionare named David Xanatos bought the castle and transported the whole structure to Manhattan where he placed it on top of the Eyrie building which he owned. It is high enough to be above the clouds- thus the conditions of the spell were met and the Gargoyles were revived. Now- this clan must adjust to this new age and gain friends- like Detective Elisa Masa who reveals that Xanatos revived them to exploit them for his unscrupulous ends. This is coupled by the fact that another Gargoyle comrade- Demona- is alive from their age- and is now an insane renegade bent on the extermination of humanity. Rebelling against them- the clan abandon the castle and pledge to protect New York like they protected the castle in the past.,TV-PG,Animation- Action- Adventure- Comedy- Crime- Drama- Family- Fantasy- Mystery- Romance- Thriller,3

Jose- Henrietta's handler doesn't like the way she and the other girls are being treated as tools for massacre and it pains him everyday to see Henrietta and her friends having to go through this type of life. But if Henrietta and the others want to live to see tomorrow- they have to play the guinea pigs and earn their keep- by getting their hands dirty for the Social Welfare agency- who is responsible for giving them their second chance at life. Because if they don't play by the agency's rules...they will die.,TV-14,Animation- Action- Drama- Sci-Fi,1

Fragments from the asteroid- and even from the moon itself- penetrate Earth's atmosphere and make impact. Even though the initial damage is minimal- nerves are frayed throughout the planet. There is significant physical damage to the lunar surface- but experts quickly conclude there will be no lasting ramifications. Then strange anomalies begin to manifest themselves on Earth.

The world's leading scientists- including Alex Kittner- Maddie Rhodes and Roland Emerson- begin piecing together evidence that suggests the moon's properties- and its orbit- may have been permanently altered. Their fears are realized when the anomalies increase to the point where the effect of "simulated" gravity is being manipulated by increased electromagnetic surges coming from the moon.

The town's long history of strange disappearances and ghost and monster sightings form the basis for its thriving tourist industry- and as such- the gang's parents and some people (mostly Mayor Fred Jones Sr. and Sheriff Bronson Stone) are not happy that their children are debunking all the supernatural goings-on that bring in so much revenue as the overwrought schemes of charlatans and criminals. In addition to the traditional cases they always solve- the team finds itself being nudged into the uncovering of a dark secret that is hidden in the past of Crystal Cove- covered up by parties unknown. The new Mystery Incorporated is following cryptic hints from a faceless mystery-man known only as "Mr. E". The new Mystery Incorporated is unearthing the legend of a cursed Conquistador treasure- the secret history of Crystal Cove's founding Darrow Family- and the mysterious- unsolved case involving four mystery-solving youths and their pet-the original Mystery Incorporated. Standing in the way of their solving this mystery- however- are the romantic entanglements pulling the kids apart: Shaggy finds himself unable to put his new romance with Velma ahead of his longtime friendship with Scooby- while Daphne pines for a trap-obsessed Fred- who obliviously struggles to realize he shares her feelings too. As they investigate further the mystery about the curse of Crystal Cove- they discover that a creature known as "The Freak of Crystal Cove" threatens and stalks anyone who comes near the haunted treasure. They uncover the Freak's true identity to be Mayor Fred Jones Sr. who reveals that Fred's true parents are Brad and Judy from the original Mystery- Inc. In the aftermath- Fred goes off to find his real parents and breaks his engagement with Daphne- declaring that "Mystery- Inc. is dead". Shaggy's parents send Shaggy to a military academy and Scooby-Doo to a farm. As Professor Pericles flaunts his two pieces of the Planospheric Disc- Scooby-Doo vows to get the gang back together and go after him.,TV-Y7-FV,Animation- Adventure- Comedy- Crime- Drama- Family- Fantasy- Horror- Mystery,2

Kikyo died of her wounds and had the jewel burned with her body. Kagome is one day pulled into the ancient well on her family's shrine and thrown into the past- 50 years after Kikyo's death. She befriends Kaede- the late Kikyo's sister- who realizes Kagome is Kikyo's reincarnation. They are attacked- and learn that Kagome has the Shikon no Tama- but it's actually inside her body! Kagome accidentally awakens the dog-demon Inuyasha- and frees him after the jewel has been ripped from her body. Now Inuyasha wants the jewel back- but Kagome can't let him have it. He is forced (by Kaede's magic) to wear a necklace that allows Kagome to control him with one word- "Sit!"- which sends him face-first into the ground. Kagome accidentally shatters the jewel- and now she and Inuyasha have to work together to find all the pieces before they fall into the wrong hands.

He is forced (by Kaede's magic) to wear a necklace that allows Kagome to control him with one word- "Sit!"- which sends him face-first into the ground.

During the final segment of the show- a celebrity guest revealed his/her own secret- each followed by a segment- in which the panelists participated.

It- too- was a huge success- and also marked a return to the game's tried-and-true formula of answers and questions (after a slightly-modified remake six years earlier failed to catch on). Three contestants- including a returning champion- competed. Six categories are announced (e.g.- Art World- Cooking- 20th Century Republicans- "Friends (1994)"- Muscle Men and College Girls Wearing White T-shirts)- each having five answers ostensibly graded by difficulty- from $100 to $500. The champion chose a category and dollar amount (e.g.- "College Girls Wearing White T-shirts for $100")- to which host Trebek reads the answer ("Inspector 12 must give her seal of approval before a college girl can wear one of these plain white T-shirts"). Contestants had to respond in question form ("What is Hanes?") ; if correct- they won the value of the question; if he/she was incorrect- failed to answer in time or phrase in the form of a question- that amount was deducted (hence- the dollar amount was "always in jeopardy") and his/her opponents could answer; having enough incorrect answers often led to negative scores. Thereafter- the contestant providing the last correct question selected next- and the process repeated; some answers made use of audio and/or video clues. Hidden behind one of the answers was a "Daily Double" space- with the contestant selecting that space able to wager up to all his/her current winnings or up to $500 if he/she had less) on the answer. After all 30 answers have been revealed (or sometimes- an undefined time limit expired)- the game moved into "Double Jeopardy!" Gameplay was the same in "Double Jeopardy!" except six new categories were announced and the answers had values of $200 to $1-000 and two "Daily Double" spaces were hidden (with contestants able to wager up to $1-000 if they had less). At the end of the "Double Jeopardy!" round- all contestants with at least $1 were eligible to play "Final Jeopardy!"; however- anyone with $0 or a negative score was disqualified from further play. Trebek announced a category- and the contestants (before seeing the answer) wagered up to everything they had on their ability to answer. Contestants had 30 seconds to write what they believed was the correct question. Those who were correct had the amount they wagered added to their winnings; however- any incorrect questions or failing to phrase properly lost what they wagered. The contestant with the most cash was champion- kept his/her winnings and got to return the next day. Champions competed until they won five shows (at which point they retired undefeated and- starting in 1997- also won a new car) or until they were defeated. All five-time champions and other high-scoring contestants over a period of time participated in a Tournament of Champions- the winner earning an additional $100-000; there were also teen- college- senior and international tournaments and celebrity shows conducted (the winners of the non-celebrity tournaments also earned a spot in the Tournament of Champions). In the fall of 2001- several changes were made- including the use of a "Clue Crew" (new regulars illustrating answers in selected categories by going "on location")- and an increase in the dollar values of the answers (from $200 to $1-000 in Jeopardy! and $400 to $2-000 in Double Jeopardy!) ; another running change through the years was the addition of "celebrity guests" reading certain answers.
